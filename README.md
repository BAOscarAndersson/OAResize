# OAResize
Intended as an example of my code and not recommended for use.

Compensates 1bpp .TIF images for fan-out in a web-feed printing press.
Resizer.cs contains the main loop and code for the program.
BBimage.cs is a library I've made for manipulatin .TIF files,
it contains lots of code that's not relevant for OAResize.
Uses BitMiracle.LibTiff.NET for decoding/encoding the .TIF files.
